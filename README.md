# Vst-Filter

## Building

After installing [Rust](https://rustup.rs/), you can compile deepfilter-vst as follows:

```shell
cargo xtask bundle deepfilter-vst --release
```

This project is very much a WIP, but the plugin should work. It does not yet have any configuration and hasn't been tested thoroughly.
